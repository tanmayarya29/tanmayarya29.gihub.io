            <li>Almond Milk recipe is simple and very easy. You just require almonds (1 cup) and water.</li>
            <li>Soak one cup sweet almonds in water for eight hours. The soaking helps in better digestion and absorption of almonds in the body as nuts contain phytic acid which inhibits the absorption of many vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>Remove the peels. Put almonds in grinder, add some lukewarm water and grind well.</li>
            <li>Strain this through cheesecloth to get extract. Again put the grinded almonds from cheesecloth, in grinder and grind again adding some water.</li>
            <li>Keep repeating till smooth Almond milk is obtained.</li>
            <li>You can store this in fridge for 3-4 days. You can add green cardamom to this milk for improving aroma and taste.
Almond milk prepared from one cup or 100 gm, is good for four servings.  Each serving provides approximately 105 calories, 4g of protein, 3.6g of carbohydrate, 1.9g of fibre, 23 mg of calcium, 5.1mg of sodium and 9.2 g of total fat.</li>

Anjeer fruits and leaves have been extensively used in the management of plasma glucose level. They contain healthy compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidants that play an important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These flavonoids have antihyperglycemic properties that alter glucose and oxidation metabolisms. Flavonoids present in them modulate glucose transport and significantly decrease elevated plasma glucose level.<br>
Ferulic acid is a predominant phenol compound that suppresses high plasma glucose level and alleviates oxidative stress. Antioxidants present in anjir neutralize the harmful free radicals and combats oxidative stress.<br>
Anjeer Leaves are more beneficial than anjeer fruits. Anjeer leaves help in supporting functional control of diabetes. The leaves regulate the amount of sugar captivated into the body after meals. Blood sugar alteration rate may become less frequent.

Research has shown that dried anjeer help in relaxing the gut. This property is attributed to the presence of ALKALOIDS, FLAVONOIDS, COURMARINS, SAPONINS, and TERPENES. It has also shown to have an anti-spasmodic effect, that is, it helps to relieve spasm of muscles. Anjeer also inhibits contractions and thus, helps the muscles to relax. Because of its anti-spasmolytic effect, it has also been recommended for the treatment of different hyperactive gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Anjeer has a very rich nutrient profile, that is, it is an important source of many vitamins, minerals, phenolic compounds, antioxidants, and flavonoids. The presence of so many health-promoting compounds in anjir helps to modulate the immune response and alleviates diseases.<br><br>
The Total White Blood Cell Count also increased in a group treated with anjir fruit extract. This increase may be related to the presence of phenolic compounds such as CAROTENOIDS, FURAN-OCOUMARINS, PSORALEN, and ANGELICIN. These phenolic compounds strengthen the immune system and boost the production of white blood cells.

Anjeer tree leaf extract has hypolipidemic activities and it helps in lowering plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels but increased the plasma levels of HDL – high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (good cholesterol). Such an increase in HDL cholesterol level protects the heart and keeps cardiovascular diseases at bay. The leaf extract increases the production of APOLIPO-PROTEIN A-1 and modifies remodeling of HDL particles within the blood vessels.
In addition to this, APOLIPO-PROTEIN A-1 also contributed to anti-inflammatory and antithrombogenic (prevents the formation of a clot and thus, protects against heart diseases) properties. Therefore, it also cuts the risk of coronary heart diseases.

It has been found that both dried and fresh anjeer fruits contain protein. Iron and protein are necessary for the formation of hemoglobin and presence of both these nutrients make it a perfect fruit for hemoglobin synthesis.
The presence of so many nutrients and health-promoting compounds are necessary for the process of blood cell formation (hematopoiesis). Thus, anjeer fruit benefits in improving the hematological parameters.

Dates make a healthy substitute for white sugar due to the nutrients, fibre and antioxidants they provide. They’re full of natural sugar, yet they’re low on the glycaemic index. This means, they don’t take your blood sugar for a wild ride like refined sugar does.<br>
One study found that consumption of dates resulted in a significant reduction in postprandial glucose excursions. The research concluded that, in spite of having high sugar content, date consumption had beneficial effects on serum triacylglycerol and oxidative stress and did not worsen serum glucose and lipid / lipoprotein patterns. <br>
In addition, date seed extract has a hypoglycaemic effect. It is observed that when date fruit is given in combination with insulin, blood glucose levels decrease significantly toward normal as compared to the effect of insulin administered as a single drug for treatment of diabetes.
Dates are loaded with fibre so they have a positive effect on the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. They support weight reduction, improve disturbances of carbohydrate and fat metabolism, and help in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.<br>
Dates provide protection against deterioration of the peripheral nerve due to its anti-oxidative property. That’s how they have a preventative approach towards peripheral diabetic neuropathy.8 In addition, dates are loaded with abundant vitamins and
minerals which are beneficial for people with diabetes.
Some of the vitamins present in dates and their action in cases of diabetes are given here.<br><br>

Vitamin A helps retain your eyesight by fighting against diabetic retinopathy.<br>
Vitamin B1 protects against nerve damage.<br>
Vitamin B2 improves your body’s metabolism.<br>
Vitamin B6 helps treat diabetic neuropathy.<br>
Vitamin B5 prevents burning sensations in the feet.<br>
Vitamin K activates proteins and calcium which help in clotting of the blood.<br>
Manganese regulates your body’s blood sugar levels.
Copper reduces many biochemical problems like excessive tissue oxidation and protein damaging glycation.
Magnesium prevents chances of getting type 2 diabetes.

Dates are an almost ideal food, providing a wide range of essential nutrients and potential health benefits. They are a good source of energy, due to their high natural sugar content like glucose, fructose, and sucrose. These sugars can be easily processed and utilized by the body for an instant burst of energy when needed.

Date palm fruits provide protection against inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. Potassium is one of the prime ingredients in promoting a healthy and responsive nervous system and it also improves the speed and alertness of brain activity.<br>
The vitamins present in dates make it an ideal boost to the nervous system health and functionality. Dates are helpful for lowering the inflammatory marker interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the brain which is responsible for causing Alzheimer’s disease. Apart from this, a diet rich in dates improves memory, learning ability, and has beneficial effects in lowering the risk, delaying the onset or slowing down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
Regular consumption of these fruits is helpful in reducing the activity of amyloid beta proteins which can form plaques in the blood vessels and outside the neurons of the brain leading to neural death. Their consumption is also associated with lower risk of neurodegenerative disorders and better cognitive performance in elderly people.

The nuts are packed with many important B-complex groups of vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin, thiamin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B-6, and folates. 100 g of peanuts provide about 85% of RDI of niacin, which contributes to health and blood flow to the brain.</td>

There are multiple mechanisms by which peanuts encourage weight loss. The fibre and protein in peanuts promotes feelings of satiety. Although peanuts are high in calories, some of the fat in peanuts is resistant to digestion and not fully absorbed by the body. Consumption of peanuts also results in higher resting energy expenditure, increasing overall calorie burn. Including peanuts in a meal plan for weight loss can make it easier to reach your goals.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), walnuts are rich in omega 3 fatty acids that have been shown to help improve heart health.  Fresh raw walnuts are rich in amino acid l-arginine, and monounsaturated fatty acids (72%) like oleic acid.<br>
It also contains essential fatty acids (EFAs), such as linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and arachidonic acids. The inclusion of these nuts in any diet can help prevent coronary heart diseases by favouring a healthy lipid supply.<br>
A study published in the journal Metabolism suggests that consuming walnuts significantly lowered the LDL (bad) cholesterol and increased the level of HDL (good) cholesterol in the participants. Researchers at the University of Munich Medical Center, Germany, found that consuming walnuts also reduced ApoB levels, a marker used to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular diseases.<br><br>
<b>Reduce Inflammation - </b>
The polyphenolic compounds and phytochemical substances found in walnuts reduce the effects of inflammation in the body.  This has beneficial implications in a number of realms, including cardiovascular and oncology health.

Walnuts help you feel full, which means that they increase satiety.  Researchers from Harvard Medical School found that people who consumed shakes containing walnuts had an increased level of fullness during the day as compared to people who had placebo shakes.  This study did, however, utilize a small size, so more research is needed to confirm these results. Regardless, the rich source of protein and fibre makes walnuts a healthy snacking option, especially for vegetarians.  However, they should be consumed in moderate quantities as an excess of it could result in weight gain.

Walnut oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can help improve memory and focus, says a report published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health, and Aging.  Omega-3 fatty acids, coupled with iodine and selenium ensure optimum functioning of the brain. These nuts are included in the Mediterranean diet and they are also known to give relief from cognitive disorders like dementia and epilepsy.<br><br>
Mood Booster - 
It is thought that insufficient amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (contained in walnuts and a few other foods), may cause hyperactivity, irritability, and tantrums. According to a 2016 study published in the Nutrients Journal, when healthy, non-depressed males were administered with walnuts, there was a significant improvement witnessed in their moods.  Supplementing a child’s diet with these nuts compensates the deficit in EFAs and may help alleviate their mood. This is even applicable to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who are battling depression and stress after trauma.
